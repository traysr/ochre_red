Here is a copy of a drawing by Rubens I did recently. 
I am experimenting with a digital _Aux Trois Crayons technique_ where we should be able draw and erase the three colors independently. Although this can be done using layers in any drawing software, I wanted to simplify it, and so wrote an app for it. The drawing is done with my [Tactilis Slate](http://tactilis.design) app for iPad, using an Apple pencil. Note that this is not image processing, the drawing and shading is still done by hand, but the app helps you draw and erase colors independenly without affecting the marks from other colors.
